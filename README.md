## Project Description
This purpose of this repostitory is to showcase my MGT4250 Data Visualization course project at Elon University. In this project, I wanted to look at the monetary value of attending college in terms of annual income after graduation. In other words, I'm looking at the financial value of college. Of course, there are several considerations for an individual to take when choosing a college to attend, but this project will focus on financial aspects. The questions that I would like to answer are the following:  
### Questions of interest
- How much does college major impact the earnings of an individual?
- How much does location of college impact the earnings of an individual?
- How much does level of degree impact earnings after graduation?
- What is the debt to income ratio after graduation?
### Importance
- This is *especially* **important** because
 1.  The upfront cost of college is often a huge financial investment and can take up to many years for a student to
pay it off before it is considered a net positive financially. 
 2.  The price of this investment can vary greatly depending on college tuition in different regions of the country. Not to mention, there is a large disparity of income between college majors.

## Data Description
The data used in these visualizations come from the College Scorecard website which is maintained by the US Department of Education. In order to access the data, I have uploaded two zip files to this repository, one named Most Recent Cohorts Field of Study and the other named Most Recent Cohorts Institution. Each one of these zip files contain an Excel sheet, so there are two Excel sheets in total. Once you have extracted these two Excel files then you will have downloaded the data needed for the visualizations.
#### The first visual uses the Stabrr data column which contains a list of all US states and territories in string format. It also uses the Mdn Earn Wne 4 yr data column which contains individual incomes earned 4 years after completing college in integer format.
#### The second visual uses the Creddesc data column which contains degree levels by description in string format. Is also uses the Mdn Earn Wne 4 yr data column.
#### The third visual uses the Cipcode data column which contains numerical ids for college majors in string format. For this visual I grouped the Cipcode data into groups according to similar majors and created a new column called Field of Study in string format. It also uses the Mdn Earn Wne 4 yr data column.
#### The fourth visual uses the Grad Debt Mdn data column which contains the total amount of debt for an individual after completing college in float format. It also uses the Mdn Earn Wne 4 yr data column.
