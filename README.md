## Project Description
This repostitory is to support the completion of the MGT4250 course project at Elon University. In this project, I wanted to look at the monetary value of attending college in terms of annual salary after graduation. In short, I wanted to answer the following hypothetical question from a prospective student's perspective: If I were to attend college, how would I maximize my potential earnings after graduation? Of course there are other factors at play when choosing to attend a university, but this project will focus mostly on the financial aspect of college attendence.
